<h1>Virtual Pet Project 🐶🐱</h1>

<h3>A project designed to demonstrate and provide exposure to basic OOP concepts</h3>

<h3><u>Overview of Files</u></h3>

<h4><b>src/pet.js<b>: This file approaches things from the traditional way of writing
OOP code in Javascript (without using classes)</h4>

<h4><b>src/pet_new.js<b>: This file contains the same logic as in src/pet.js
but makes use of the class syntax available in ES6</h4>
